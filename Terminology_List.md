### 1. **Labeled Data**
  Data where each example has a known output or target value (label). For instance, in a dataset of emails, each email might be labeled as "spam" or "not spam."
  - **Example**: A dataset of medical records where each record has a corresponding diagnosis (label).

### 2. **Unlabeled Data**
  Data without corresponding output or target labels. The goal in this case is to find patterns or structures in the data without supervision.
  - **Example**: A set of images without any labels indicating what the images represent.

### 3. **Supervised Learning**
  A type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data. It tries to learn a mapping from input features to target labels.
  - **Example**: Predicting house prices based on features like the size of the house, number of rooms, etc., where the price is the label.

### 4. **Unsupervised Learning**
  A type of machine learning where the algorithm works with unlabeled data and tries to find patterns or relationships without explicit supervision or labels.
  - **Example**: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior without predefined labels (clustering).

### 5. **Reinforcement Learning**
  A type of machine learning where an agent interacts with an environment and learns through trial and error, using rewards or penalties to guide its learning.
  - **Example**: A game-playing agent that learns to maximize its score by making good moves.

### 6. **Self-Supervised Learning**
  A learning method that uses parts of the data as pseudo-labels to help the model learn. It combines the ideas of supervised and unsupervised learning, where the model learns to predict parts of the data from other parts.
  - **Example**: Predicting missing words in a sentence based on the surrounding words (commonly used in natural language processing).

### 7. **Classification**
  A type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict which category or class an input belongs to. The target variable (Y) is categorical.
  - **Example**: Predicting whether an email is "spam" or "not spam."

### 8. **Regression**
  A type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict a continuous value. The target variable (Y) is numerical.
  - **Example**: Predicting the price of a house based on its size, number of bedrooms, etc.

### 9. **Clustering**
  An unsupervised learning technique where the goal is to group similar data points together based on some measure of similarity.
  - **Example**: Grouping customers based on their buying habits into different segments.

### 10. **Feature**
  An individual measurable property or characteristic of the data. In machine learning, features are the input variables used by the model to make predictions.
  - **Example**: In a dataset of houses, features might include square footage, number of bedrooms, and neighborhood.

### 11. **Model**
   A mathematical or computational representation of a process that can be trained to make predictions or decisions based on input data.
   - **Example**: A linear regression model that predicts house prices based on features like size and location.

### 12. **Training Data**
   The subset of data used to train a machine learning model. This data includes both the input features and the corresponding output labels (in supervised learning).
   - **Example**: A dataset of historical stock prices used to train a model to predict future prices.

### 13. **Testing Data**
   The subset of data that is used to evaluate the performance of a trained model. This data is separate from the training data to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
   - **Example**: A separate set of stock price data used to check how well the model's predictions match the real values.

### 14. **Overfitting**
   A modeling error that occurs when a machine learning model learns the details and noise in the training data to the point where it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data.
   - **Example**: A model that predicts house prices so precisely based on the training set that it fails to generalize well to new houses.

### 15. **Underfitting**
   A situation where a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and testing data.
   - **Example**: A linear regression model that tries to predict house prices using only one feature when more features are needed.

### 16. **Algorithm**
   A step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. In machine learning, algorithms are used to learn patterns from data.
   - **Example**: The k-means algorithm for clustering data into groups.

### 17. **Accuracy**
   A common metric for evaluating classification models. It measures the proportion of correctly predicted labels out of all predictions made.
   - **Formula**: 
   ```math
   \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of correct predictions}}{\text{Total number of predictions}}
   ```

### 18. **Precision and Recall**
   Metrics often used in classification problems, especially for imbalanced data.
     - **Precision**: The proportion of positive predictions that were actually correct.
     - **Recall**: The proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified by the model.
   - **Formulas**:
     - Precision = $\( \frac{TP}{TP + FP} \)$ (True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives))
     - Recall = $\( \frac{TP}{TP + FN} \)$ (True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives))

### 19. **Training**
   The process of teaching a machine learning model by feeding it data so it can learn the underlying patterns or relationships.
   - **Example**: Feeding a dataset of emails labeled "spam" or "not spam" to a classification model.

### 20. **Test Set**
   A portion of the data that is set aside and used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model after it has been trained.
   - **Example**: A set of emails that were not included in the training process, used to test the accuracy of the spam filter.
### 21. **Curve Fitting**
In the context of regression, curve fitting refers to finding the best-fitting curve (or line in the case of linear regression) that minimizes the error between predicted and actual values. In simple linear regression, this results in finding the best straight line to represent the relationship between input and output.

### 22. **Multiple Linear Regression**
   This is an extension of linear regression to handle multiple input features (i.e., \( $d > 1$ \)). The model predicts the output based on a combination of multiple input variables. The general form is $\( Y = X \beta \)$, where $\( X \)$ is a matrix of input features, and $\( \beta \)$ represents the coefficients.
