### **1. General Notations**
- **$x$**: A single data point (or feature vector) containing the input features.  
  Example: In a house price prediction problem, $x$ could be a vector representing the features of the house, like square footage, number of rooms, etc.

- **$y$**: The target value or label associated with a data point $x$.  
  Example: For house price prediction, $y$ could be the actual price of the house.

- **$\hat{y}$**: The predicted output from the model for a given input $x$.  
  Example: If you use a model to predict the price of a house based on features $x$, then $\hat{y}$ is the predicted price.

- **$X$**: The feature matrix consisting of all the training data points. It has $m$ samples (data points) and $n$ features (input variables).  
  Example: For multiple houses, $X$ could be a matrix where each row represents a house's features.

- **$Y$**: The target vector for all the training samples. It contains the true values corresponding to the data points in $X$.  
  Example: For multiple houses, $Y$ would be a vector of the true house prices.

- **$m$**: The number of training examples or data points in the dataset.  
  Example: If you have data for 100 houses, $m = 100$.

- **$n$**: The number of features in each data point.  
  Example: If you are using square footage, number of rooms, and other features to predict house prices, $n =$ number of features (e.g., 5 features).

### **2. Vectors and Matrices (Linear Algebra)**
- **$\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$**: A feature vector containing $n$ features. This represents a single data point with $n$ attributes.  
  Example: A house's features like square footage, number of rooms, etc.

- **$\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$**: The feature matrix, where each row represents a data point and each column represents a feature.  
  Example: If you have 100 data points (houses) and 5 features per house, $\mathbf{X}$ will be a matrix with 100 rows and 5 columns.

- **$\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$**: The weight vector containing model parameters that scale or adjust the importance of each feature in the prediction.  
  Example: In linear regression, $\mathbf{w}$ determines how much each feature influences the predicted output.

- **$\mathbf{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$**: A weight matrix used in multi-class models (like in neural networks for classification tasks).  
  Example: For multi-class classification, $\mathbf{W}$ can hold weights for each class, with each column corresponding to a different class.

- **$\mathbf{b}$**: The bias term, which allows the model to fit data better by shifting the output. It is typically added to the weighted sum of features.  
  Example: In a linear model, the bias helps adjust the prediction independently of the features.

- **$\mathbf{I}_n$**: The identity matrix of size $n \times n$, which is a square matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.  
  Example: $\mathbf{I}_2$ is a 2x2 matrix:
  
  ```math
  \mathbf{I}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
  ```

- **$\mathbf{x}^{T}$**: The transpose of vector $\mathbf{x}$, which switches its rows and columns.  
  Example: If $\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2]^T$, then its transpose is $\mathbf{x}^{T} = [x_1, x_2]$.

- **$\mathbf{X}^{-1}$**: The inverse of matrix $\mathbf{X}$, which, if multiplied by $\mathbf{X}$, results in the identity matrix.  
  Example: In linear algebra, solving $\mathbf{X} \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{y}$ for $\mathbf{w}$ involves using $\mathbf{X}^{-1}$.

### **3. Probability and Statistics**
- **$p(x)$**: The probability distribution of the random variable $x$. This tells you how likely different values of $x$ are.  
  Example: For a dataset of house prices, $p(x)$ could represent the probability distribution of house prices in a given region.

- **$P(A|B)$**: Conditional probability of $A$ given $B$, which measures the probability of event $A$ happening given that event $B$ has already occurred.  
  Example: The probability that a house price is high given that the house has a pool.

- **$\mathbb{E}[X]$**: The expected value (mean) of a random variable $X$, which represents its average value.  
  Example: If you have a set of house prices, $\mathbb{E}[X]$ would be the average house price.

- **$\text{Var}(X)$**: The variance of random variable $X$, which measures how much $X$ deviates from its mean.  
  Example: In house prices, higher variance means more fluctuation in prices across houses.

- **$\text{Cov}(X, Y)$**: The covariance between two random variables $X$ and $Y$, which measures how much they change together.  
  Example: Covariance between house size and price, where both typically increase together.

- **$\sigma^2$**: The variance of a random variable, which is the square of the standard deviation.  
  Example: Variance in house prices.

- **$\sigma$**: The standard deviation of a random variable, which measures the spread of values around the mean.  
  Example: A higher $\sigma$ indicates that house prices are more spread out from the mean price.

- **$\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$**: A normal (Gaussian) distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$.  
  Example: Many features in machine learning (like height or weight) often follow a normal distribution.

- **$H(X)$**: The entropy of a random variable $X$, which measures the uncertainty or unpredictability of $X$.  
  Example: In classification tasks, entropy measures how mixed the classes are in a dataset.

- **$D_{\text{KL}}(P || Q)$**: Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which measures how one probability distribution $P$ diverges from another distribution $Q$.  
  Example: Used to measure the difference between predicted and true distributions in classification tasks.

### **4. Machine Learning Models**

#### **Linear Regression**
- **Hypothesis**:  
  $\hat{y} = \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x} + b$  
  This is the predicted value of the target variable, where $\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}$ is the weighted sum of the input features and $b$ is the bias term.

- **Loss Function (Mean Squared Error)**:  
  ```math
  J(\mathbf{w}, b) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
  ```  
  The MSE measures the average squared difference between the true labels and the predicted labels, and it's used to optimize the model parameters.

#### **Logistic Regression**
- **Hypothesis**:  
  $\hat{y} = \sigma(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x} + b)$, where $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$ is the sigmoid function  
  The sigmoid function squashes the output between 0 and 1, making it suitable for binary classification.

- **Loss Function (Binary Cross-Entropy)**:  
  ```math
  J(\mathbf{w}, b) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left[ y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i) \right]
  ```  
  This loss function is used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model.

### **5. Optimization and Learning**
- **$\alpha$**: The learning rate controls how much the model parameters are updated during each step of gradient descent.

- **$J(\theta)$**: The cost (or loss) function that we aim to minimize to make our model as accurate as possible.

- **$\theta = (\mathbf{w}, b)$**: Model parameters, including weights and biases, which are updated during the training process.

- **Gradient Descent Update Rule**:  
  ```math
  \theta := \theta - \alpha \nabla J(\theta)
  ```  
  This rule updates the model parameters by moving them in the opposite direction of the gradient of the cost function, scaled by the learning rate $\alpha$.
